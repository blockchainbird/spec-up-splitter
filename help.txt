Usage:
  npx spec-up-split [pathToTermsFile] [pathToTermsDir]

Example:
  npx spec-up-split custom_terms.md custom-terms-output

This tool is designed to split a single markdown file containing terms and their definitions into multiple markdown files, each containing a single term and its definition.

Arguments:
- pathToTermsFile: Optional. The path to the markdown file containing terms and definitions to be split. If not provided, defaults to 'terms_and_definitions.md'.
- pathToTermsDir: Optional. The path to the directory where the individual term files should be saved. If not provided, defaults to 'terms-definitions'.

Requirements:
- The tool requires a 'specs.json' file to be present. This file should be in a standard Spec-Up install.

Behavior:
1. The tool first checks for the existence of 'specs.json'. If it is not found, the tool stops with an error message.
2. It then checks if the source terms file exists. If not, it stops with an error message.
3. If the specified directory for term files already exists and is empty, the tool proceeds with the splitting operation. If it contains markdown files, it stops.
